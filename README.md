# JS-clock
 A clock built with JavaScript. This project was built for fun as part of a 30 Day Javascript Challenge! 
 
 ### Lessons Learned 
 This project drew on my pre-existing knowledge of manipulating and working with time and dates as well as using transitions. I learned: 
 - How to rotate a line 90 degrees 
 - How to change the origin of a rotation using transform-origin
 - How to use transition-timing-function to give the clock hand a realistic "tick" motion
 - How to run something every second using setInterval (whether that's "hi" in the console log or the motion of the second hand moving every second)
 - How to turn time into degrees in order to program the clock hands to rotate like an actual clock
 
 Manipulating time can be tricky, but it was fun exercise!
